# BudgetApp-Tutorial
My first real-world tutorial project with JS/HTML/CSS:
- The BudgetApp has some basic features:
 + Add/Remove Item(income and expenses)
 + Calculate the total income and expenses
 + Calculate the percentages of each expense over the total income
 + Display the current month and year
